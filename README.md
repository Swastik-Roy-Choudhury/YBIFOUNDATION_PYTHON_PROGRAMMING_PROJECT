Title:
"Python Code for Bank Churn Modelling Dataset Creation and Preprocessing"

Objective:
The objective of this Python code is to create and preprocess a dataset for Bank Churn Modelling.
The code involves gathering relevant customer data, handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, 
and performing necessary feature scaling to prepare the data for machine learning models aimed at predicting customer churn. 
Additionally, it aims to provide insights into customer behavior by analyzing key factors contributing to churn.

Project Explanation:-
This project, titled "Python Code for Bank Churn Modelling Dataset Creation and Preprocessing," 
focuses on building and preparing a dataset for predicting customer churn in the banking sector. 
The code involves collecting relevant customer data and cleaning it by handling missing values. 
It then applies encoding techniques to convert categorical data, such as customer demographics, 
into numerical values suitable for machine learning. Feature scaling is performed to ensure consistent 
data ranges for accurate model training. The preprocessed data is ready for machine learning algorithms 
that aim to predict customer churn, helping banks take proactive steps to retain customers. 
Additionally, the project provides insights into factors contributing to customer churn, 
enabling data-driven decisions for better customer retention strategies.
